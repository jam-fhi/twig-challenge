## Scenario

A user-facing interface of any kind is not required, all you need to do is implement a function or class that can be called on to provide the following behaviour:

- Given an array of length >= 0, and a positive integer N, return the contents of the array
  divided into N equally sized arrays.
- Where the size of the original array cannot be divided equally by N, the final part should have
  length equal to the remainder.

### Example:

Inputs [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and 3
Output [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]

## Dependencies

npm i

then NodeJS to run the moacha tests.

## Deployment

Clone or download the github repository to a folder on your local machine.
